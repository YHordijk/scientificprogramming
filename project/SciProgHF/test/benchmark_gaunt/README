!
! This test calculates the energy of the CO molecule using the full Dirac-Coulomb-Gaunt Hamiltonian
! In addition we also compute some properties of this molecule.
!
! The test is meant to check the implementation of the Gaun interaction for energies and
! properties for Hartree-Fock and DFT hybrid functionals. 
!
! At the moment of making this test only the so-called AOFOCK build option can be used and
! the Gaunt integrals will NOT be included in 4-index transformations. Correlated energies
! will therefore be only approximate wiith Hamiltonian model.
!
! We assume that the correlation consistent basis sets are available in your standard path. These sets can be
! obtained from the DALTON distribution and may later be included in the DIRAC distribution as well.
