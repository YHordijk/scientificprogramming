! EFG finite field and analytic calculations on hydrogen fluoride with a small basis set.
!
! The studied component of EFG is qzz at the F nucleus.
!
| The run zerofield serves to generate the MO-vectors and gives the EFG
! expectation value at the DHF & MP2 level. The finite field approach 
! serves to compute a CCSD(T) correlation contribution that
! can be added to the analytical HF value. We use relaxed orbitals for this
! purpose as this gives the most rigorous result.

! Notes: - the MP2 method overshoots the correlation correction by a factor of 2
!        - the basis is too small to give reliable results (this is only a test !)
!
! The used analytic formula is qzz_F(method,strength) = (E(+F)-E(-F))/(2*F)
