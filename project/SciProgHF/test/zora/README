! This test calculates variations of ZORA using two test systems
! U91+ (2p space only) using a basis set of Dyall.
! Xe atom using a small basis set of Faas.
!
! The test checks the ZORA and scaled ZORA option and
! the so-called full density or ZORA-4 and approximate density ZORA schemes.
! The scaling will only affect the output of orbital energies
! The difference bwetween ZORA and ZORA4 is of importance for many-electron systems, where
! the full density scheme gives a more accurate results, but at the expense of
! cost of a regular dirac calculation. The approximate density scheme should
! be of the order of a (LL+SL) calculation somewhat cheaper).
