This example demonstrates the shortcomings of restricted kinetic balance
for calculation of magnetic properties. At the 4cHF/aug-cc-pVDZ level
the isotropic shielding of the helium atom is 39.7301 ppm using RKB 
and 59.6079 ppm using UKB; the latter captures the magnetic balance. 

A better approach, though, is to perform an SCF calculation using RKB and 
the extend the coefficients with the UKB complement for the response 
calculation. This is accomplished with the RKBIMP flag.
