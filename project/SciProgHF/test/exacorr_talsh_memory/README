! requirements: 
! TAL-SH library (Dmitry Lyakh): OpenMP, CUDA (optional)

In order to run with TAL-SH a certain amount of working memory is reserved by:
*****
.TALSH_BUFF
50
*****
You should set it to the memory available on a node!

You can always find a memory estimate in the header of ExaCorr:
-----------------
- Estimating memory requirements
 -- nao  ( scheme 1-3  ) :         5 GB
 -- nvir ( scheme 4/42 ) :         5 GB
-----------------

With the following option you can run the code without doing computations and only testing allocations:
******
.MOINT_SCHEME
5
