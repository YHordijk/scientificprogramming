
these tests calculate the NMR shielding tensor in LAO basis in few different ways:
==================================================================================


* inputs lao_shield_rearrange* calculate the NMR shielding tensor as follows:
  - the property gradient is calculated from Eq. (31) in JCP-131-124119-2009 (connection matrices are present)
  - the final shielding tensor is calculated from Eqs.(40-42) in JCP-131-124119-2009, so:
     + the hermitian part of the occ-occ blocks of the connection matrices are formed (and should equal to the first-order derivative of the overlap distribution matrix) and used in Eq. (41)
     + the occ-virt blocks of the connection matrices are combined with the optimized (before) response parameters, kappa, as in Eq. (42)

* inputs lao_shield_lr_rearrange* 
  - in the formulation of the property gradient we don't use the connection matrices, only the magnetic derivative of the overlap 
  - we solve linear response equations, as a solution we get the new response parameters, kappa
  - the final shielding tensor is the calculated from Eqs.(40-42) in JCP-131-124119-2009, where parameters A take the role of kappa
