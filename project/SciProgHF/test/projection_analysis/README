! This test performs a projection analysis for the methane molecule.
! A standard Mulliken population analysis is included for comparison.
! It is a quite interesting exercise to compare the atomic charges
! obtained with various basis sets by the two methods. Whereas the 
! projection analysis is quite stable, the Mulliken population analysis
| is strongly basis set dependent.
|
| Note furthermore that the fragments are not calculated in the full
| molecular basis, but their own basis set. This is what is obtained with
| the .OWNBAS keyword. 
|
| In general the projection analysis is based on symmetry-independent centers;
| this means that in C2v symmetry the fragments for the water molecule will
| be the oxygen atom and the H2 fragment.
|
| In order to do a projection analysis on true atomic fragments one has to
| lower symmetry. Note that one may calculate in maximum symmetry and then
| use the ACMOUT keyword under **GENERAL to dump coefficients in C1 symmetry.
|
| Note also the use of weak electric fields to break degeneracies and thereby obtain
| atomic orbitals with well-defined mj values.
