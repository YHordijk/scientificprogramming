! This tests performs a geometry optimization of the water molecule while freezing
! the 1s and 2s orbitals. The water molecule has a bond angle of 104.5 degrees,
! whereas this angle tends towards 90 degrees for the heavier homologues. It has been
! stated that the 90 degree angle for the heavier homologues is due to the increased
! energetic separation of valence s and p orbitals, blocking hybridization. In this
! test run we freeze the 2s (and 1s) orbital obtained from a preliminary calculation
! of the oxygen atom. These orbitals have been calculated in the oxygen basis and
! we may therefore use them through all iterations of a geometry optimization (neat, huh ?).
! This must be done numerically for the moment. 
!
! At the end of the geometry optimization the bond angle closes, but not all the way to 90
! degrees. This is due to Pauli repulsion between the hydrogen atoms, as explained by
! Kutzelnigg in his classic paper in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 23 (1984) 272.
