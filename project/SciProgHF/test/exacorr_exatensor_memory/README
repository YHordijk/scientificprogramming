! requirements: 
! ExaTENSOR library (Dmitry Lyakh): MPI, OpenMP, CUDA (optional)

In order to run ExaTENSOR one can give the memory per MPI process with (optional)
*****
.TALSH_BUFF
50
*****
The total memory is than given by multiplying it with # MPI processes. 
  
You can always find a memory estimate in the header of ExaCorr:
-----------------
- Estimating memory requirements
-- nao  ( scheme 1-3  ) :         5 GB
-- nvir ( scheme 4/42 ) :         5 GB
-----------------
  
With the following option you can run the code without doing computations and only testing allocations:
