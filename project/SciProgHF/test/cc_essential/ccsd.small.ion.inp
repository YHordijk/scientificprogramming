! This test calculates the energy of singly ionized water.
! Here we use the CCSD(T) approach with an average-of-configuration HF, 
! which is quite OK for doublet states. An alternative is to use the
! Fock space approach, but then the triples are not available.
!
! WARNING : TESTING PURPOSE ONLY
! We use only LL-type integrals : results are not reliable !
