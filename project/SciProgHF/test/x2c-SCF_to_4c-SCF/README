! This test calculates the SCF energy of the water molecule using different choices for the Hamiltonian:
! 	- X2C with 2e-spin-orbit-corrections from AMFI
! 	- 4c-Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian
!	- X2C with 2e-spin-orbit-corrections from AMFI (until convergence) which is followed by a 4c-Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian
!	  calculation to produce a final 4c-wave function.
!
! NOTE: the last test is at present failing because the feature is not correctly working (yet). this will hopefully be
!       resolved soon. The reference numbers in the result part for this test are WRONG (manually changed)!!!
