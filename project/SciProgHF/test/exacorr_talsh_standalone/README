! Exacorr MO Transformation and Coupled Cluster
! Testing the stand-alone version of exacorr by running the TALSH version and creating a DFCOEF file.
! Exacoor is used in the second step which restarts on (only) the DFCOEF file
! NB: Only the first step is done automatically be ctest, you should run exacorr using the
! provided run_exacorr.sh script.
! Note that there are two tests, the one with dichloroethane takes quite some time and is not run 
! by default. For this one you could also just run the SCF (modify the input), because all
! exatensor needs in the second step is the DFCOEF that is already complete after the SCF.
