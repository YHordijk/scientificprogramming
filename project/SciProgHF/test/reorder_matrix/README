This test is a unit test for the reorder_matrix subroutine in gpdyall.F
It tests all pathways in reorder_matrix, using a vector of length 10
consisting of numbers from 0.0 to 9.0, not ordered. The test first calls
sort_vector from the same file, to produce the index array for the
reordering, then the vector is reordered using reorder_matrix with a
row length of 1. The test exercises all three cases for the reordering.
The test can be run with the shell script test_reorder.sh; after running,
remove test_reorder.x.
