! This test calculates the static electric dipole polarizability of Ne
! using the GRAC and SAOP asymptotic correction schemes.
! The chosen functionals are GRAC: PBE0gracLB94
!                        and SAOP: GLLBsaopLBalpha
!
! We assume that the basis sets are available in your standard path.
! These sets can be obtained from the Dalton distribution and may later be included in the DIRAC distribution as well.
!
! Note that a coarse DFT grid and a poor convergence threshold is used.
