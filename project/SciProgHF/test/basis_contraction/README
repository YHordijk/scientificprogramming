! Calculations on water with a contracted basis set
!
| Calc 1 is with the large and small basis set given in Dirac format.
! Calc 2 is using basis sets read from MOLFDIR basis set files
!        Make sure that these basis sets are present in the executing directory
|
! Contracted "MOLFDIR" type basis set should only be used with URKBAL and
! .SPHTRA 1 0. Other options may give spurious results.
