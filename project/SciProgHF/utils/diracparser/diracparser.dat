# Contains the translationkeys for dirac output files. 
# Column 1: The key we can use in the class parse dirac.
# Column 2: Line from where we should start reading. 
# Column 3: Keyword for blocks of information.
# Column 4: Line where we should stop reading.
# Column 5: Keyword for stop reading a single block of information. A number
#	    denotes the number of empty lines we should encounter before we stop reading.
# Column 6: How the info that comes after the block keyword (column3) should be interpreted.
# Column 7-...: The columns that should be read in the block of information.
# Column 8: Factor for converting the column to different energyscale.

# GOSCIP18 is CI calculation with SCF RESOLVE 
# GOSCIP18FIXED is the same but then for fixed width columns (i.e. the symmetry
# labels are lacking spaces.
