Troubleshooting
===============

Can I move the DFCOEF file from one machine to another and restart from it?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general no, unless it is the same architecture.

What you can do instead is to export the DFCOEF in a machine independent format
using the .PCMOUT keyword. This creates a file called DFPCMO.  Copy DFPCMO to
the other machine, copy it to the scratch directory using the pam script, and
DIRAC will correctly restart from it.


I tried to restart but get the error "Incompatible number of basis functions" - what does it mean?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This probably means that you have changed the basis set. Presently DIRAC cannot
restart from DFCOEF or DFPCMO if the basis set changes (more correctly if
matrix dimensions change).
