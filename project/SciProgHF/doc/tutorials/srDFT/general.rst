Long-range WFT/short-range DFT
==============================

Long-range wave function theory (lrWFT) combined with short-range density functional theory (srDFT) is based on a separation of the two-electron interaction

.. math::

   \frac{1}{r_{12}}=\frac{erf\left(\mu r_{12}\right)}{r_{12}}
   - \frac{1-erf\left(\mu r_{12}\right)}{r_{12}}

here using the error function (erf). The first term, the long-range interaction,
is assigned to wave function theory, whereas the second term, the short-range interaction, is assigned 
to DFT. Contrary to conventional DFT the fictitious reference (Kohn-Sham) system is no longer non-interacting and can not be solved exactly, 
so that the hierarchy of approximate wave function methods must be invoked. MP2-srDFT has been implemented in DIRAC by Ossama Kullie 
and Trond Saue :cite:`Kullie2011`.
