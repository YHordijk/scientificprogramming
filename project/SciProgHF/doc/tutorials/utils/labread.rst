LABREAD
=======

LABREAD is a utility program for getting information about integrals stored on the one-electron integral file AOPROPER.
Usage is straightforward, for instance::

The notation *SY* and *AN* indicate whether the integral matrix is symmetric or not.
In general only certain combinations of large and small component blocks have been calculated.
An even operator has *TFFT*, meaning that only *LL* and *SS* blocks have been generated, whereas 
an odd operator has *FTTF*, meaning that only *LS* and *SL* blocks were generated.
For information about integral labels, see the :ref:`one_electron_operators` section.
