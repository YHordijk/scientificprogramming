CFREAD
======

CFREAD is a utility program for getting information from the file DFCOEF containig 
MO-coefficients, orbital energies and, if relevant, information about boson or linear 
symmetries. Usage is straightforward, for instance::

  dirac 26>cfread.x DFCOEF
  
   CFREAD; Information read from file : DFCOEF
  
   - Heading :DIRAC: No title specified !!!                     Tue Sep 24 23:05:49 2013
   - Total energy: -75.1621606438559979
   - Fermion ircops          :      1
  -----------------------------------
   - Negative-energy orbitals:      0
   - Positive-energy orbitals:     21
   - AO-basis functions      :     21

Note that the electronic energy is calculated before diagonalization, so that coefficients from iteration *n* 
refer to electronic energy from iteration *n-1*. At convergence this should not matter.
