VIBCAL
======

VIBCAL is a utility program allowing the calculation of vibrationally averaged properties.

Theory
------

Suppose that we have optimized the geometry of our molecule and have carried out a harmonic
vibrational analysis. For a selected normal mode we expand the electronic energy :math:`E` 
as function of the associated normal coordinate :math:`q` about the equilibrium position 
:math:`q=0`. 

.. math::

   E(q) = E^{[0]} + E^{[1]}q + \frac{1}{2}E^{[2]}q^2 + \frac{1}{6}E^{[3]}q^3 + \ldots;\quad
          E^{[n]} = \left.\frac{\partial^n E}{\partial q^n}\right|_{q=0}

We note that :math:`q=0`  implies :math:`E^{[1]}=0` and that the second derivative :math:`E^{[2]}` corresponds to the force constant :math:`k`. We furthermore expand some property :math:`P\equiv P(q)` in the same manner. 

From perturbation theory we now obtain an expression for the expectation value of the property :math:`P` for vibrational level :math:`\nu` of the 
selected normal mode

.. math::

   P_{\nu}=\left<\nu\left|P(q)\right|\nu\right>_q = P^{[0]} 
   + \frac{1}{2}P^{[2]}\left(\frac{\hbar}{\mu\omega_e}\right)\left(\nu+\frac{1}{2}\right)
      -\frac{1}{2}P^{[1]}E^{[3]}\left(\frac{\hbar}{\mu\omega_e}\right)^2\frac{\left(\nu+\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\hbar\omega_e}+\ldots

..      -\frac{1}{16}P^{[2]}E^{[4]}\left(\frac{\hbar}{\mu\omega_e}\right)^3\frac{n^2+n+\frac{1}{2}}{\hbar\omega_e}

where appears the reduced mass :math:`\mu` and harmonic frequency :math:`\omega_e=\sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}` of the selected normal mode.

Experimentally one can observe the change in this expectation value between two vibrational levels, given by

.. math::

   P_{\nu'} - P_{\nu} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\hbar}{\mu\omega_e}\left[P^{[2]}-\frac{1}{\mu\omega_e^2}P^{[1]}E^{[3]}\right]\Delta\nu;\quad \Delta\nu=\nu' - \nu

We note that the purely electronic contribution :math:`P^{[0]}` does not contribute to the vibrational shift. Furthermore, we may note that for a purely
harmonic mode (:math:`E^{[3]}=0`) and a property purely linear in the normal coordinate (:math:`P^{[2]}=0`) the vibrational shift is strictly zero.

Usage
-----

VIBCAL will read a formatted file of distances, energies and property values. The distances may be in Angstroms, but all other quantities have to be in atomic units.
VIBCAL will next6, through a dialogue, with the user generate the necessary derivatives for the calculation of vibrational shifts of the property.

Example: Parity violation shift associated with the C-F stretch of CHFClBr
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We start from a set of CCSD(T) energies and  B3LYP parity violation energies 
calculated along the normal coordinate :math:`Q` associated with the C-F stretch of the chiral CHFClBr::

   -0.5000000000000000  -0.61012399429E+03     2.633089925380E-17

   -0.1000000000000000  -0.61102238183E+03     4.933686545396E-18
    0.0000000000000000  -0.61103293760E+03     1.544047622021E-18
    0.1000000000000000  -0.61102641387E+03    -1.026099838285E-18
    0.2000000000000000  -0.61101190951E+03    -2.755550508570E-18
    0.5000000000000000  -0.61095789506E+03    -1.870247865432E-18

The coordinates are in this case given in Angstroms. We fire up VIBCAL::

         1. Print additional information
   
   Reduced mass (in Daltons)

Here we chose the default print level. For the reduced mass you have to check with the preceeding vibrational analysis. We give::

   Name of the input file (A30) with potential/property curve

It is a good idea to have a telling name of the input file ::

   CCpot_B3LYPprp
   Select one of the following:
     1. Bond lengths in Angstroms.
     2. Bond lengths in atomic units.
    (Note that all other quantities only in atomic units !)
   1

Here we choose Angstroms for the normal coordinate. ::

   Select one of the following:
     1. Numerical derivatives (assumes fixed step length).
     2. Polynomial fits    
   2

In this example we do not have a fixed step length for our distances, so we select the second option 
which uses polynomials fits. ::
   
    We have    7 points
    Give order of polynomial:
    5
    Select point for the calculation of derivatives
    0.0

The distances refer to the normal coordinate associated with the C--F stretch, so we set :math:`Q=0.0` since this
refers to the equilibrium structure. ::

   Results have been written to CCpot_B3LYPprp.vibcal
