Installation instructions for system administrators
===================================================

Please read the other installation sections for details
but the installation procedure is typically this::

  $ ./setup --mpi --mkl=parallel --prefix=/full/install/path/
  $ cd build
  $ make [-j]
  $ export DIRAC_TMPDIR=/full/path/scratch
  $ export DIRAC_MPI_COMMAND="mpirun -np 8" # make test will run with MPI using 8 processes
  $ make test
  $ make install

This will install binaries, run scripts, the basis set library,
as well as tools into the install path.

Advise users to always set a suitable scratch directory::

  $ export DIRAC_TMPDIR=/full/path/scratch

If your system runs MPI jobs with mpirun, the pam script can be called with the ``--mpi`` flag::

  $ pam [other flags] --mpi=8      # will run "mpirun -np 8 dirac.x"

You can define a custom MPI launcher with DIRAC_MPI_COMMAND, in this case do not use ``--mpi flag``::

  $ export DIRAC_MPI_COMMAND="mpirun -np 8"
  $ pam [other flags]              # no --mpi flag
