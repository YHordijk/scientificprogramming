Good Fortran90 programming practices
====================================

We present some proper Fortran90 programming practices.
By adopting them by programmers one could be working with readable and clean code.

Module names and file names
---------------------------

Use the same name for the module and the file. For instance,
if your module is called foobar, call the file foobar.F90.
This makes it easier to find the source code linked by "use foobar".

It is possible to group several modules into one file. Do it when your modules share some common characteritics.
Modules grouping in files prevents flood of individual module source files slowing down the repository connections.

Example module
--------------

.. literalinclude:: nice_module.F90
      :language: fortran

Include files and common blocks in the F90 era
----------------------------------------------

Please do not introduce new common blocks.
When you write new code and use F90, there is no need to
introduce new common blocks (and include files) - use modules instead, they are much safer.
Common blocks make the code harder to maintain.

Sometimes you have to use already present include files in F90. To make this work:
 - only use "!" to start comments in include files (all F77 compilers understand this)
 - continuation use a & in column 73 of the first line and a & (nothing else!) in column 6 of the following line. 
This will work with both free form and fixed form when the file is included)
 - declare all variables explicitly, so that they can be used with the *IMPLICIT NONE* declaration.

There is a Python-script *reformat_includes.py* in the utils directory,
that reformats include files according to these rules.


I/O control statements
----------------------

To ease the localization of input/output-type bugs during the code run please provide main I/O statements (OPEN, READ)
with the IOSTAT parameter evaluation or with other error-trapping programing scheme.

Examples: ::

  !... control reading if gaunt=true
  READ(LUCMD,*,IOSTAT=IOS) ILLINT,ISLINT,ISSINT,IGTINT
  IF (IOS.NE.0) THEN
    WRITE(LUPRI,'(/,2X,A)') 'Error in SCF INTFLG reading !'
  & //'4 parameters needed for Gaunt term !'
    CALL FLSHFO(LUPRI)
    CALL QUIT( 'DHFINP: Error in INTFLG reading for GAUNT=true!')
  ENDIF

or (assuming that LU is correct unit number:  ::

  WRITE(LU,desired_format,IOSTAT=IOS) SOMETHING
  IF (IOS.NE.0) THEN
  ! Yell, that some variables in "SOMETHING" are out of desired format-bounds ;
  ! this could indicate run-time error (getting variable(s) hurt before)
  ! might activate program stop (CALL QUIT)....
  ENDIF

F90 INCLUDE keyword
-------------------

Do not use it. Use #include preprocessor statements only.

SIXLTR SBRTNE NAMING OBSOLT
---------------------------

Because it is so hard to read and understand.
There is no need to to stick to 6 letter names anymore.
The limit is 31 characters. Use meaningful names so that other people (and you in a couple of months)
will understand your code.

Dynamical strings
------------------

The programmer may utilize short dynamical strings carrying descriptive labels, and attach this
data type to his own data structures.

The module is ::

 use mystring

Methods at hand are: 

i)  creating the string

::

  type(string) :: this_string
  call make_string(this_string,'some description text')

ii) printing the string on the LUPRI channel 

::

  call print_string(this_string)

iii) copying one string into another

::

  call copy_string(this_string, another_string)

iv) canceling (deallocating) the string

::

  call cancel_string(this_string)

For more details about the dynamical string functionalities check directly
the :download:`dynamic_string.F90 <../../../src/gp/dynamic_string.F90>` source file.

Code debugging with LINEFILE
----------------------------

C-debugging symbols are defined by the preprocessor on each line. 
Therefore it is useful to insert printouts of file name and line number: ::

 print *, 'I am in file ',__FILE__, ' on line ', __LINE__

Now, of course we don't want to write that everywhere. What one can do is to use a macro: ::

 #define MYFUNCTION(x) myfunction(x,__FILE__,__LINE__)

This allows '''myfunction''' to print good error messages, because it knows the value of __FILE__ and __LINE__. 
But the macro has to be defined somewhere, so you need an '''#include "mymem.h"''' or something. 

Here is an example that works, just for using __FILE__ and __LINE__ statements: ::

  subroutine mysub(someargument,file,line)
    character(*) file
    integer someargument, line
    print *, 'mysub(',someargument,')'
    print *, 'I was called in file "',file,'" at line ',line
  end subroutine mysub

  #define mysub_wrapped(arg) mysub(arg,__FILE__,__LINE__)

  program test
    integer x
    x = 12
    call mysub_wrapped(x)
  end program test

For large scale employment one has to put the '''#define''' in an include file, or better, in a Fortran90 module.
