Transfering uncommitted code between machines
=============================================


As regular tarball
------------------

For this make sure that you also take the .git directory
otherwise compilation will complain with::

  fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
  CMake Error at cmake/ConfigGitRevision.cmake:9 (string):
    string sub-command STRIP requires two arguments.

Also make sure that you get all the external sources.
In other words if you manually tar up a fresh DIRAC clone without .git
that has never been built, externals will be missing.


Using "make release" tarball
----------------------------

The tarball produced with make release
does not require Git.


Using scp
---------

This should work. But even better is git clone over ssh (below).


Git clone
---------

You can git clone from one machine to another. Note that you cannot push to a
non-bare repository. In other words if you clone a regular clone, you cannot
push to it.
