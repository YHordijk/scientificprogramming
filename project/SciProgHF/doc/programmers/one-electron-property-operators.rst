One-electron property operators
===============================

4-component one-electron operators are discussed in :ref:`one_electron_operators`.
Here we look at the handling of matrix representation of such operators inside DIRAC.
The general form of 4-component one-electron operators is

.. math::

   {\,}^{4c}\Omega = \sum_{i=1}^{n_{comp}}{\,}^{4c}M_i f_i P_i

where :math:`{\,}^{4c}M_i` is a :math:`4\times 4` matrix, :math:`f_i` a real factor, 
:math:`P_i` a real scalar operator and the sum running over the numbers of components 
of the operator (not to be confused with the number of components of a spinor).

The matrices :math:`{\,}^{4c}M` are either *even*, sampling LL- and SS- blocks of the 
matrix of the scalar operator :math:`P`, or *odd*, sampling the LS- and SL-blocks of the
scalar operator.

The general input routine for 4-component one-electron operators is XPRINP (src/prp/paminp.F).

List of 4-component operators
-----------------------------

Each unique operator gets an index and is added to the list of 4-component one-electron operators
stored in the common block *dcbxpr.h*. 
For each 4-component operator the following information is stored:

*PRPNAM*  
   (user-defined) operator name
*IPRTYP*  
   operator type (see :ref:`one_electron_operators`), 
   corresponding to a particular linear combination of :math:`4\times4` 
   matrices . This automatically defines :math:`n_{comp}`.
*IPRPSYM*  
   spatial symmetry (boson irrep)
*IPRPTIM* 
   time-reversal symmetry (-1,0,+1)

For each component:

*FACPRP*  
   real factor :math:`f_i` 
*IPRPLBL*  
   pointer to scalar operator :math:`P_i`

List of scalar operators
------------------------
A list of scalar operators is kept in common block *dcbprl.h*. For each scalar operator
the following information is recorded:

*PRPLBL*  
   name of property label identifying the corresponding integrals on file AOPROPER
*IPRLREP*  
   spatial symmetry (boson irrep) of scalar operator
*IPRLTYP*  
   symmetry of scalar operator under matrix transpose (-1,0,1)
*PDOINT*   
   a CHARACTER*4 array where the four slots correspond to the LL, SL, LS and SS block 
   of the scalar property matrix and have three possible values:

      - '0': the block is not used (and therefore not generated)
      - '+': the block is used 
      - '-': the block is used and scaled with minus one

Generating the matrix of a 4-component property operator
--------------------------------------------------------

In the present setup DIRAC/HERMIT generates the integrals corresponding to the list of 
scalar operators in  *dcbprl.h* and writes them to disk on the file AOPROPER. 
For property matrices that are symmetric or anti-symmetric only the lower triangle
is stored.

DIRAC comes with a utility program *labread.x* which can be used to print the list of 
labels (and more) corresponding to the integrals stored in AOPROPER.
