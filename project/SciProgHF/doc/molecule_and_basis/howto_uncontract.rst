How to uncontract basis sets
============================

It is boring to uncontract basis sets manually.
There is a keyword for it::

  **DIRAC
  [...]
  **INTEGRALS
  *READIN
  .UNCONTRACT

Note that there is the limit for maximum number of exponents in one shell, 
which specified in the "include/cbirea.h" file (as MAXPRD = 35).
