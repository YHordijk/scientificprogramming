How to specify the molecule and basis set using the traditional mol files
=========================================================================

The procedure used to read mol files is as follows: first, the basis set for
the large component will be read in from the the mol file; then the small
component basis set is generated automatically via the kinetic balance
prescription, but can (by experienced users) also be specified explicitly. Try
this only if you have studied the theory and know what the criteria for small
component basis sets are, there are many pitfalls that one needs to be aware
of!

.. warning::

   The traditional mol file is entered in fixed format (with few exceptions). This means that exact
   position and spacing matters. If you misplace the charge, the number of
   centers, etc., then DIRAC will not be able to read the structure and basis set
   information correctly.  Until you get familiar with the format, we recommend to
   copy existing mol files and adapt them.

We will learn the mol file format using the following example::

  DIRAC

  FINISH

This is the water molecule using the cc-pVDZ basis for the large component
basis set. The first 3 lines are arbitrary comment lines. You can leave them
blank or write some note to yourself but they have to be there. Line 4
specifies a cartesian GTO basis set (C) and 2 atom types (basis set types).  So
after line 4 DIRAC expects 2 basis set types and here they are - first
hydrogen::

          1.    2
  H1   -1.4523499293         .0000000000         .8996235720
  H2    1.4523499293         .0000000000         .8996235720
  LARGE BASIS cc-pVDZ

then oxygen::

          8.    1
  O      .0000000000        0.0000000000        -.2249058930
  LARGE BASIS cc-pVDZ

and we finish off with a FINISH in the final line.

You can already guess the meaning of the numbers. We have 2 hydrogens with a
nuclear charge of 1.0 and one oxygen with a nuclear charge of 8.0.  Then come
the atom symbols and the coordinates in bohr followed by the large component
basis set label. DIRAC will look up this label in the basis set library and
complain if it does not exist. Note that the atom label (H1, H2, O) is only for
you so that you find it in the output. It does not matter to the code. The code
will identify basis sets based on the nuclear charge, not the label.
The cartesian coordinates may be given in free format. However, the name
of the atom must still be left four places, and no coordinates must
enter the four first positions.

DIRAC typically runs in cartesian GTO.  Note that by default the transformation
to spherical harmonic basis (modified for the small components) is done in the
transformation to the orthogonal basis. Spherical Gaussians (S) are allowed in
2-component calculations.


Default coordinates are in bohr, how can I use angstrom instead?
----------------------------------------------------------------

See the "A" in line 4 in position 20? If it is there, DIRAC will
read in angstrom, if this position is blank, then DIRAC will read
in bohr (default)::

  DIRAC

          1.    2
  [...]


Nuclear exponent
----------------

You can modify the default gaussian exponent
for the nuclear charge distribution by giving a floating
point value somewhere within the space specified below::

  DIRAC
           1         2         3           # this is a comment line

As an example, here is the Ne atom with a custom nuclear
exponent of 10.0D8::

Fitting basis set
-----------------

In the development version of DIRAC it is now possible to make use of density
fitting. In such calculations, it is mandatory to include a basis set used to
expand the density.  This is done adding a line with the FTSET keyword after
the coordinates for a given atom type.  Basically all the options available in
the definition of large or small basis sets are applicable to the fit set (i.e.
the use of a set from the library, explicitly typed basis, even/well-tempered
etc). Here is an example::

  DIRAC

Point charges
-------------

You can add point charges with the "LARGE NOBASIS" basis set specification (or, equivalently, with "LARGE POINTCHARGE").
For example adding two point charges, both of -1.6, to the water example above::

Multiple basis sets from the basis set library
----------------------------------------------

As an alternative to the BASIS option described above, it is possible to use
specify different basis set files via the MULTIBASIS keyword. The MULTIBASIS
option is present to allow easier inclusion of different sets of diffuse and/or
polarization functions to a reference basis set. The syntax for this keyword is
very similar to that of the BASIS::

  DIRAC


  C   2
          1.    2
  H1   -1.4523499293         .0000000000         .8996235720
  H2    1.4523499293         .0000000000         .8996235720

  LARGE MULTIBASIS 2 cc-pVDZ cc-pVDZ-diffuse
  FINISH

After the keyword an integer with the number of files to be read should
be specified. It is followed by the name of the different basis set
files, each separated by a whitespace. The only limitation for the
number of basis set files is that the total lenght of this line should
not exceed Fortran's maximum allowed line size (80 characters).

Following EXPLICIT is the highest angular quantum number plus one.  In this
case it is 3, since we are using a *spd* basis set.  Following this number are
the number of blocks for each *l*-value. The memory requirements grow rapidly
with the number of basis functions in a block (note for instance that four *g*
functions actually are 60 basis functions, as there are 15 cartesian components
of each *g* function). Memory requirements can therefore be reduced by
splitting basis functions of the quantum number into different blocks. This
will, however, decrease the performance of the integral calculation.

Following the LARGE EXPLICIT line we see a line with a comment.  Lines starting
with either !, $, or # are comments and are ignored by the code.

The next line starts with a single character describing the input format of the
basis set in this block.

The default format is 8F10.4 which will be used if left blank. **Be very
careful when using this default format as it will miss any exponential
parameter standing to the right of the 10 characters**. In this format the
first column is the orbital exponent and the seven last columns are contraction
coefficients. If no numbers are given, a zero is assumed. If more than 7
contracted functions occur in a given block, the contraction coefficients may
be continued on the next line, but the first column (where the orbital
exponents are given) must then be left blank.

An F or f in the first position (like in the example above) will indicate that
the input is in free format. This will of course require that all contraction
coefficients need to be typed in, as all numbers need to be present on each
line. However, note that this options is particularly handy together with
completely decontracted basis sets, as described below. Note that the program
reads the free format input from an internal file that is 80 characters long,
and no line should therefore exceed 80 characters.

The numbers in the line "f  10    4" are the number
of of primitive Gaussians in this block (10) and the number of contracted
Gaussians in this block (4).  If a zero is given for he number of contracted
Gaussians, an uncontracted basis set will be assumed, and only orbital
exponents need to be given.

One may also give the format H or h. This corresponds to high precision
format 4F20.8, where the first column again is reserved for the orbital
exponents, and the three next columns are designated to the contraction
coefficients. If no number is given, a zero is assumed. If there are
more than three contracted orbitals in a given block, the contraction
coefficients may be continued on the next line, though keeping the
column of the orbital exponents blank.


Specification of how to generate small component functions

If a 0 (as in this example) or no number is given, the small component
functions are generated both upwards and downwards (default).  If the number is
1, the small component functions are generated upwards, If the number is 2, the
small component functions are generated downwards.  For other values no small
components functions generated.


MOLFDIR-type basis sets
-----------------------

The MOLFDIR basis set file(s) (here: Oxygen-xyz.bas) must be copied to the
scratch area, for example using the pam script::

  DIRAC


  C   2
          1.    2

Even-tempered basis sets (geometric progressions)
-------------------------------------------------

The exponents are generated in an even-tempered series:

.. math::

  \eta_{N - k + 1} = \alpha \beta^{k - 1}

with

.. math::

  k = 1, \ldots, N

::

    LARGE EVENTEMP 0.05 3.0 11 3 2 1 1
    1..5
    6..11
    7..11
    9..10

This means that alpha is 0.05, beta is 3.0, N is 11.
Highest angular quantum number plus one is 3 (s, p, and d functions),
we will have 2 blocks for the s, 1 block for p, and one block for d.
The s blocks go from exponent 1 to 5 and from 6 to 11, p goes from 7 to 11,
d goes from 9 to 10.


Well-tempered basis sets
------------------------

This works very much like LARGE EVENTEMP, except
that the exponents are generated in an well-tempered series:

.. math::

  \eta_N = \alpha

and

.. math::

  \eta_{N - k + 1} = \eta_{N - k + 2} \beta [ 1 + \gamma (\frac{k}{N})^n ]

with

.. math::

  k = 1, \ldots, N

::

    LARGE WELLTEMP 0.05 2.5 2.0 6.0 11 3 2 1 1
    1..5
    6..11
    7..11
    9..10

Here alpha is 0.05, beta is 2.5, gamma is 2.0, n is 6.0,
and N is 11.


Explicit small component basis set
----------------------------------

This is for experts.  Following the line or block specifying the LARGE
component basis set you can override the default kinetic balance prescription
and specify the small component basis set either using SMALL EXPLICIT or using
SMALL MOLFBAS, in analogy to LARGE EXPLICIT and LARGE MOLFBAS After the large
component basis set the small component basis set can be specified. If nothing
is specified it is equivalent to specifying SMALL KINBAL (see below). There are
three possibilities for giving the basis set.


Family basis sets
-----------------

Input for basis sets where the same set of exponents are used for all
functions. This is analogous to the well- and even-tempered basis sets except
that the exponents are not calculated from a formula, but must be given in the
file. These exponents may come from a basis set optimization with GRASP::

How to set the charge of the system
-----------------------------------

By default the charge of the atom/molecule is zero.
You can change this in the mol file::

  DIRAC

       *** <- you can use these positions on next line
  C   2  1
          1.    2
  H1   -1.4523499293         .0000000000         .8996235720
  H2    1.4523499293         .0000000000         .8996235720

This is water with charge plus 1.  Alternatively you can specify the occupation
explicitly in the inp file and leave it blank in the mol file.


Automatic augmentation with diffuse functions
---------------------------------------------

By using a augmentation prefix you can use automatic augmentation to extend
Dunning, Dyall, and Turbomole basis sets with diffuse exponents.

The following augmentation prefixes are recognized::

  d-aug-cc-p...
  t-aug-cc-p...
  q-aug-cc-p...
  5-aug-cc-p...
  6-aug-cc-p...
  7-aug-cc-p...

  s-aug-dyall...
  d-aug-dyall...
  t-aug-dyall...
  q-aug-dyall...

  s-a-Turbomole...
  d-a-Turbomole...
  t-a-Turbomole...
  q-a-Turbomole...

What the code does is that it sorts exponents for each angular momentum,
calculates the factor between the two most diffuse exponents, and adds a new
exponent (or new exponents) by keeping this factor (even tempered
augmentation).  If an angular momentum only has one exponent, then the
progression cannot be calculated (obviously), and a factor 3.5 is used.  This
is a choice.

Automatic augmentation can be useful but it should not be used in a black box
manner.  You are strongly encouraged to define DEBUG_PRIMITIVES in
abacus/herrdn.F and to examine which exponents have been added. The code simply
augments and does not consider whether it uses the original SCF set exponents
or correlating exponents.


How to force specific symmetry
------------------------------

In all the above examples we have not specified symmetry explicitly.  In this
case DIRAC will detect and use the highest symmetry available in the code.  In
doing so it may translate and rotate the molecule (check output).

There are two alternatives to this.  The first is that we can turn off symmetry
completely and force C1 (by placing a 0 at the right place; the 0 means
zero symmetry generators)::

  DIRAC


  C   2    0
  [...]

  DIRAC

Alternative two is to specify an explicit symmetry other than C1.  For this we
need to remove all symmetry-generated centers and specify the coordinates only
for the symmetry-unique centers::

  DIRAC


  C   2    2  X  Y
          8.    1
  O      .0000000000        0.0000000000        -.2249058930
  LARGE BASIS cc-pVDZ
          1.    1
  H     1.4523499293         .0000000000         .8996235720
  LARGE BASIS cc-pVDZ
  FINISH

We give only one hydrogen center, the other is generated by symmetry operations.
This molecule has two symmetry generators (second 2 in line 4).

.. warning::

   If you fail to remove the centers generated by symmetry operations, DIRAC
   will apply symmetry operations to them which will re-generate the symmetry-unique centers.
   You will get more than one center at the same position and DIRAC will stop with the
   error "nuclei too close".

All available symmetry groups and the corresponding symmetry
group specification strings are given in the following list::

  C   ?    3  Z  Y  X   # group:      D2h
                        # operations: reflection(xy)
                        #             reflection(xz)
                        #             reflection(yz)

  C   ?    2XY  YZ      # group:      D2
                        # operations: rotation(z)
                        #             rotation(x)

  C   ?    2 Y X        # group:      C2v

                        #             reflection(yz)

  C   ?    2  ZXYZ      # group:      C2h
                        # operations: reflection(xy)
                        #             inversion

  C   ?    1XY          # group:      C2
                        # operations: rotation(z)

  C   ?    1  Z         # group:      Cs
                        # operations: reflection(xy)

  C   ?    1XYZ         # group:      Ci
