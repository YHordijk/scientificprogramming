For each unique pair (A,B) of centers a formatted file is created, containing
four columns of numbers: The origin is placed at atom A, and the first column
gives the coordinate in Angstroms along the line between centers A and B. The
following columns contain the total, large and small component density,
respectively (in atomic units). The file is named
'RH',NAMN(ICENTA),NAMN(ICENTB),IDEGB where ICENTB is the name of
symmetry-independent center B and IDEGB the numbering of the dependent center.
Underscores are inserted wherever there are blanks. The generation of the
density requires the coefficient file DFCOEF. Note that one can in principle
obtain the density along any line simply by introducing ghost centers.
