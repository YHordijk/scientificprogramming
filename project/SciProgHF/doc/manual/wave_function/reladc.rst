RELADC, FANOADC and LANCZOS
===========================

This section lists the available keywords for RELADC, FanoADC and the closely connected
iterative LANCZOS diagonalizer in DIRAC.

If you want to perform RELADC/LANCZOS calculations for the one- and two-particle
propagator or a FanoADC calculation you invoke all of them by setting the
.RELADC keyword in the \*\*WAVE FUNCTION
Section.

The RELADC/LANCZOS calculation is then individually controlled in the
\*\*RELADC and \*\*LANCZOS input sections.

The FanoADC calculation is a special case of a one-particle propagator
calculation. Therefore the keywords are part of the \*\*RELADC section.

starstar(RELADC)

keyword(DOSIPS)

Do Single Ionization Potentials.
If you intend to do single ionization spectra calculations then set this keyword.
Closely related to SIP calculations is the keyword

keyword(ADCLEVEL)

Here you determine the perturbational order for a SIP calculation.

::

     ADCLEVEL = 1  strict second order
     ADCLEVEL = 2  extended second order
     ADCLEVEL = 3  third order + constant diagrams

*Default:*

::

    ADCLEVEL = 3 (including constant diagrams)

*Input example:*

::

   .ADCLEVEL
   2


keyword(SIPREPS)

Integer array of length 32. Specifies the symmetries of the one-hole
final states (SIP) to be calculated. If you do not enter this array
all symmetries are checked for possible final states and those are
calculated in the respective perturbational order. You can also specify
symmetries individually if you are interested only in a few by listing the
number of requested symmetries followed by the individual irrep numbers.

*Default:*

::

    SIPREPS(1:32) = 0  (no symmetries preselected, all are calculated)

*Input example:*

::

   .SIPREPS
   8
   1,3,5,7,17,19,21,23


keyword(READQKL)

Read back previously calculated constant diagrams in SIP runs. This is a restart
option to avoid the most time consuming step in SIP runs. The constant diagrams
for all symmetries are stored in the file QKLVAL.

keyword(NOCONS)

Block calculation of constant diagrams in third-order SIP calculations.
ADC is still executed up to third order but in the hole/hole block the (time consuming)
constant diagrams are omitted. Skipping constant diagrams reduces accuracy but
increases speed considerably. Not recommended for production runs.

keyword(VCONV)

Determines convergence of the inverse iteration in the calculation of
the constant diagrams. If these iterations take much time you can reduce
tightness by setting VCONV to 1.0E-05, 1.0E-04 asf. Check accuracy
of results when you activate this option.

*Default:*

::

    VCONV=1.0E-06

*Input example:*

::

    .VCONV
    1.0E-04

keyword(DOFULL)

Lanczos is automatically invoked in a single and double ionization calculation. If you want to 
invoke an additional full diagonalizer set this keyword. Attention: ADC matrices can become very large. A full
diagonalization is therefore supported only for matrix dimensions up to 5000 x 5000 and is useful
for test purposes only.

keyword(DODIPS)

Do Double Ionization Potentials.
If you intend to do double ionization spectra calculations then set this keyword.
The keyword .ADCLEVEL does not apply to DIP runs because the perturbational order
is set fixed to 'extended second order'.

*Default:*

::

    DODIPS = F

keyword(DIPREPS)

Integer array of length 32. Specifies the symmetries of the two-hole
final states (DIP) to be calculated. If you do not enter this array
all symmetries are checked for possible final states and those are
calculated in the respective perturbational order. You can also specify
symmetries individually if you are interested only in a few. Input is
analogous to SIPREPS.

*Default:*

::

    DIPREPS(1:32) = 0  (no symmetries preselected, all are calculated)

keyword(ADCTHR)

In DIP calculations only matrix elements whose amount is larger than ADCTHR
will be written to disk. This is due to the large matrices occurring in DIP
runs. Tests have shown that you can reduce matrix
size by a factor of two setting ADCTHR to 1.0E-05 with an accuracy loss
in the meV region. Perform accuracy tests for production runs since
the behavior is system-dependent.

*Default:*

::

    ADCTHR = 0.0 (all nonzero matrix elements are written to disk)

*Input example:*

::

    .ADCTHR
    1.0E-05

keyword(FANO)

This keyword activates the FanoADC module. It requires the specification of the
initial and final states to be investigated. By running the default calculation
settings, specified ionization spectra are calculated as well. This can be turned
off by using the keyword .FANOONLY.

*Default:*

::

    False

For a Fano calculation it is crucial to use a proper (and normally large)
basis set. It has been shown, that it is beneficial to add KBJ exponents to the
atoms themselves or to ghost atoms surrounding the system in order to span a basis
for the interaction region of the final state and the outgoing electron.
By this the user
should take care not to loose symmetry by specifying the positions of ghost atoms.

More information about the proper selection of basis sets can be found
in the PhD thesis of Elke Fasshauer (link).

keyword(FANOIN)

Here the initially ionized state is specified by symmetry and relative spinor number.
The following example chooses the first spinor in the first symmetry to be the
initial state:

::

    .FANOIN
     1 # symmetry
     1 # relative spinor number

You can find a table of spinors, their symmetries and relative and absolute
spinor numbers at the beginning of every ADC calculation with the *same* active
space. 
For the case of the Auger process of a neon atom, this looks like:

::

    Spinor   Abelian Rep.         Energy   Recalc. Energy
     O    1    1    1g      -32.8174679811  -32.8174680470
     O    2    2    1g       -1.9358495110   -1.9358495652
     O    1    3   -1g      -32.8174679811  -32.8174680470
     O    2    4   -1g       -1.9358495110   -1.9358495652
     O    1    5    1u       -0.8528295909   -0.8528295926
     O    2    6    1u       -0.8482685119   -0.8482685445
     O    1    7   -1u       -0.8528295909   -0.8528295926
     O    2    8   -1u       -0.8482685119   -0.8482685445
     O    1    9    3u       -0.8482685155   -0.8482685461
     O    1   10   -3u       -0.8482685155   -0.8482685461
     .
     .
     virtual orbitals

which means, that the first spinor of the first symmetry (1g) which represents
the Ne1s orbital is chosen as the initially ionized state.

keyword(FANOCHNL)

Autoionization processes decay via several channels into different final states.
These are specified in this section. In the first line the number of channels
, let us call it N, needs to be given. In the second line the number of
two-hole configurations for each channel is specified. If you chose 2 channels, you
need to put two numbers here!

The following lines give details about the channels.
For every channel a maximum 4 letter shortcut has to be specified followed
by the two-hole configurations of describing the final state. They have
to be pairs of absolute spinor numbers.

*Take care: The number of 2-hole-configurations of a channel has to be the same as you specified in the upper part. The 4 letter shortcut has to start at the beginning of the line. Do not include a space.*

This part is at the moment no black box method and the user
is required to think carefully about the selection of these final states and not
to forget a possible channel. On the other hand, this gives a lot of control to
the user to specify exactly what he/she wants to calculate.

Again the Neon atom as example:

::

    .FANOCHNL
     3       # number of channels N
     1,12,15 # number of hole configurations of the different channels
    s2       # descriptor of 2s-2 final state
     2 4     # two-hole configuration of 2s-2 final state
    sp
     2 5
     2 6
     2 7
     2 8
     2 9
     2 10
     4 5
     4 6
     4 7
     4 8
     4 9
     4 10
    p2
     5 6
     5 7
     5 8
     5 9
     5 10
     6 7
     6 8
     6 9
     6 10
     7 8
     7 9
     7 10
     8 9
     8 10
     9 10

If you change the Hamiltonian you will have to change the channel specification
as well!

keyword(FANOONLY)

This keyword enforces to run only a FanoADC run and overwrite every other
calculation of the one-particle propagator.

*Default:*

::

    False

starstar(LANCZOS)

Once the ADC matrices are stored in packed form on disk they are diagonalized
by the iterative Lanczos algorithm. The spectral information is written to
the files SSPEC.#irrep (SIPs) and DSPEC.#irrep (DIPs).
Hereby the ionization potential, the pole strength
and the error estimate are written in a line terminated by the '@' for
grep purposes. Immediately after this line follows the (indented)
configuration information belonging to this final state. This is
imaginable as a one-hole or two-hole Slater-determinant forming this
state in zeroth order. Strictly speaking, the configuration coefficients
refer to the intermediate state irepresentation basis.

.SIPITER, .DIPITER
------------------

Determines the number of Lanczos iterations in a SIP or
DIP calculation for all symmetries.
There is no need to specify the number of iterations
per symmetry because the convergence behaviour is similar within a
specific ionization class. However, DIP calculations can require
substantially more iterations for a comparable accuracy. Due to the
iterative nature of the Lanczos diagonalizer the edge values converge
very fast and some may be reproduced if SIPITER or DIPITER are set to
high values. These reproduced eigenvalues are spurious and will be
projected out from the final result. If one observes very many spurious
solutions (mainly in the SIP case) it is recommended to reduce SIPITER
accordingly.

*Default:*

::

    SIPITER = 500, DIPITER = 500.


*Input example:*

::

    .SIPITER
    1000
    .DIPITER
    2500

.SIPPRNT, .DIPPRNT
------------------

Real values. These two variables only control screen output of the
calculated eigenvalues and have no influence on the results in the
(SD)SPEC files. You can enter the threshold in eV up to which computed
IPs (SIPs, DIPs) will be printed on screen. Sometimes one is only
interested in a few lowest IPs and the screen output suffices.

*Default:*

::

    SIPPRNT = 50.0, DIPPRNT = 50.0.


*Input example:*

::

    .SIPPRNT
    20.0
    .DIPPRNT
    100.0

.SIPEIGV, .DIPEIGV
------------------

For each chosen symmetry selected by the XXXREPS array a lower and upper energy boundary
value for the corresponding method are specified. 
Only within this energy range the long eigenvectors are calculated. This is more
user-friendly since one can not anticipate the number of eigenvectors to be expected in a certain energy range.


*Default:*

::

    0.0 0.0   (no eigenvectors calculated)

*Input example:*

::

    .SIPEIGV   #(same for .DIPEIGV)
    4 # number of lines of ranges to follow
    10.0 20.0
    20.0 30.0
    0.0 0.0
    10.0 15.0

keyword(DOINCORE)

This keyword activates an incore Lanczos diagonalization. If you run jobs on machines with
large core memory you can speed up the diagonalization considerably by transferring large parts
of the ADC matrix to memory. This is especially noticeable in DIP jobs because the matrices
are much larger than in the single ionization case.
Attention: Be aware that the operating system allows you to allocate as much memory as you want.
If there is not enough physical memory the OS starts to swap portions of the memory to disk.
You have to avoid this situation since your job will not terminate in time. Check carefully that
the memory you request is physically available!
