This directory is supplied in git in order to more easily
transport datafiles. Normally this would be outside revision
control as it is not related to the building the program itself.

Contents
- directory H2:  input for DIRAC and resulting FCIDUMP file
- directory H2O: input for DIRAC and resulting FCIDUMP file
- directory FO : input for DIRAC (resulting FCIDUMP file was to big to store, will be supplied directly)

Option A: Running directly from DIRAC
1) Add the build directory to your path (test this with "which pam" that should then point to the pam inside the build directory)
2) Go to the molecule directory that you want to run (example below is for H2) and type:
pam --mol=h2.xyz --inp=hf.inp
3) The output can be inspected and should contain information about the diagonalization of the one-electron matrix at the end.

In this was you can make your own inputs and vary the molecule studied.

Option B: Using the FCIDUMP files that are provided.
1) Compile the code inside src/sciproghf. You can do this in various ways, there are no dependencies on other code, except internal ones (you should compile the auxilliary files first).
2) Go to the molecule directory that you want to run (example below is for H2) and run the executable made under 1).
3) The output is written to standard output and should contain information about the diagonalization of the one-electron matrix.


Use either A and B and let me know which one you will work on on Friday. 

In case you are wondering how B is done: in the build directory of DIRAC there is a program dirac_mointegral_export.x that can be run as follows.

pam --inp=hf.inp --mol=h2.xyz --get="MRCONEE MDCINT"
dirac_mointegral_export.x FCIDUMP

In the first line we run DIRAC and copy the binary files containing resp. 1e and 2e integrals from the working directory (that is deleted after the run) to the directory in which you have the inputs. In the second line we convert this to a text format.
